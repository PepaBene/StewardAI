-- Rollback for supabase/migrations/20261002120000_form13f_manager_coverage.sql (plan D8.4).
-- Generated from a before/after diff of the public catalog and proven by
-- apps/backend/tests/test_lifecycle_phase8.py: the migration is applied, this file is run, and the
-- catalog fingerprint (tables, columns, constraints, indexes, functions, policies, grants, seed
-- rows) must equal the one taken before the migration. Run it in a transaction, newest migration
-- first. The migration file itself is never edited.
-- DATA LOSS: drops these tables and every row in them: form13f_manager_dataset.

drop table if exists public.form13f_manager_dataset cascade;
